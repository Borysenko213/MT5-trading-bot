## Strategy Implementation

### Entry Logic (Multi-Timeframe Confirmation)

**For SELL (PainBot):**
1. ✅ D1 previous candle: small body + long lower wick
2. ✅ H4: Prior candle covers ≥50% of M15 Fib (high→low)
3. ✅ H1: Price below red shingle
4. ✅ M30 & M15: Snake is RED
5. ✅ M1: Price below red snake → break purple line → retest purple line → **ENTER SELL**

**For BUY (GainBot):**
1. ✅ D1 previous candle: small body + long upper wick
2. ✅ H4: Prior candle covers ≥50% of M15 Fib (low→high)
3. ✅ H1: Price above green shingle
4. ✅ M30 & M15: Snake is GREEN
5. ✅ M1: Price above green snake → break purple line → retest purple line → **ENTER BUY**

### Exit Logic

**Take Profit:**
- Hold for 5 minutes minimum
- Close at M5 candle close
- Wait 1 more M5 candle
- Re-entry allowed at start of 3rd M5 candle (if price beyond purple line)

**Stop Loss:**
- M5 purple line break against position
- Wait for next full confirmation cycle before re-entry

**Daily Stop:**
- Current day fills 50% of previous day's wick
- Daily loss limit reached ($40 USD)
- Daily profit target reached ($100 USD)

## Performance Expectations

Based on strategy design:

### Expected Metrics (Hypothetical - Requires Testing)
- **Win Rate:** 50-65% (conservative estimate)
- **Risk/Reward:** 1:1.5 to 1:2 (depending on market)

- **Trade Target:** $1.50-$2.00 per trade
- **Daily Target:** $100 USD
- **Daily Stop:** $40 USD
- **Account Size:** $200 (typical)

⚠️ **Note:** Actual performance will depend on market conditions, symbol volatility, and parameter tuning. Thorough backtesting and demo testing required before live deployment.
