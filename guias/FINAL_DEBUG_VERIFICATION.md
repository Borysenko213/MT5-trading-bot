## Debug Print Format Standard

All prints follow this format:
```
[DEBUG] FunctionName.method(): action/description
[DEBUG] Variable name: value
[DEBUG] Result: success/failure
```

**Examples:**
- `[DEBUG] MT5Connector.initialize() started`
- `[DEBUG] Daily P/L: profit=$2.50, loss=$0.00`
- `[DEBUG] Can trade: True, reason: OK`
- `[DEBUG] mt5.initialize() FAILED with error: (-10005, 'IPC timeout')`

---

## How to Use

### 1. Run Bot
```bash
python -m pain_gain_bot.main --bot pain --demo
```

### 2. Watch Debug Output
All `[DEBUG]` messages show execution flow in real-time.

### 3. Find Last Debug Message
The **LAST** `[DEBUG]` line shows where execution stopped.

### 4. Match to Expected Flow
Compare last message to this guide's flow diagrams.

### 5. Identify Problem
- Stopped at `mt5.initialize()` = MT5 not open
- Stopped at `mt5.login()` = Wrong credentials
- Stopped at `Outside trading session` = Normal (wait for session)
- Stopped at `Can trade: False` = Daily limit hit

---

## Most Common Blocks

### 1. MT5 Not Open (95% of issues)
```
[DEBUG] Calling mt5.initialize()...
[DEBUG] mt5.initialize() FAILED with error: (-10005, 'IPC timeout')
```
**Solution:** Open MetaTrader 5

### 2. Wrong Credentials
```
[DEBUG] Attempting login: account=19498321...
[DEBUG] mt5.login() FAILED with error: (10004, 'Invalid account')
```
**Solution:** Update config.json or create new demo account

### 3. Outside Trading Hours (Normal)
```
[DEBUG] is_trading_session(): now=12:00:00, session=19:00:00-06:00:00, in_session=False
[DEBUG] Outside trading session - sleeping 60s
```
**Status:** Normal operation, bot is waiting

### 4. No Signals (Normal)
```
[DEBUG] Step 3: Checking H4 confirmation
[DEBUG] H4 confirmed: False
[DEBUG] H4 not confirmed - returning
```
**Status:** Normal operation, market conditions don't meet strategy

---

## Testing Debug Prints

### Quick Test Script:
```bash
# Test 1: Without MT5 open (should fail at mt5.initialize)
python -m pain_gain_bot.main --bot pain --demo

# Expected last message:
# [DEBUG] mt5.initialize() FAILED with error: (-10005, 'IPC timeout')

# Test 2: With MT5 open (should proceed to main loop)
# 1. Open MT5
# 2. Run bot again
# Expected: Should reach [DEBUG] === Iteration 1 ===
```
