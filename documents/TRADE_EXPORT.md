# Trade Export Feature

The bot automatically exports all trading activity to CSV and JSON files, just like the backtest feature.

## üìÅ Where Files Are Saved

All trade history files are saved in:
```
trading/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ trade_history/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trade_history_20251016_153045.csv
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trade_history_20251016_153045.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trade_history_20251016_183020.csv
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

---

## ü§ñ Automatic Export

The bot automatically:
1. ‚úÖ **Records every trade** when it opens
2. ‚úÖ **Updates with P/L** when it closes
3. ‚úÖ **Exports to CSV** after each trade closes
4. ‚úÖ **Creates final export** when you stop the bot (Ctrl+C)

**You don't need to do anything** - it happens automatically!

## üìä CSV File Format

The CSV file contains the same columns as backtest results:

## üîÑ Comparing with Backtest Results

Both live trading and backtest use the **same CSV format**, so you can:

‚úÖ Compare backtest results with live results
‚úÖ Import both into Excel side-by-side
‚úÖ Verify the bot is trading as expected
‚úÖ Track performance over time

**Example comparison:**

| File | Trades | Win Rate | Total P/L |
|------|--------|----------|-----------|
| `backtest_PainX_400_7d.csv` | 12 | 66.7% | $12.50 |
| `trade_history_20251016.csv` | 3 | 66.7% | $2.47 |

If win rates are similar, the strategy is performing as backtested!

## üí° Tips

### Track Daily Performance
Keep each day's export file:
```
trade_history_20251016.csv  ‚Üí Friday's trades
trade_history_20251017.csv  ‚Üí Saturday's trades
trade_history_20251020.csv  ‚Üí Monday's trades
```

### Weekly Analysis
Combine multiple days in Excel:
1. Import all CSVs
2. Create a pivot table by date
3. Track weekly performance trends

### Compare Symbols
Filter by symbol to see which performs best:
- PainX 400 win rate: 70%
- PainX 600 win rate: 65%
- PainX 800 win rate: 60%

### Time Analysis
Check which hours are most profitable:
- 19:00-21:00 (session start)
- 02:00-04:00 (London open)
- etc.
